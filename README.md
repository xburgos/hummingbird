Hummingbird
===========

Hummingbird's aim is, to provide a twitter like view of the changes in a Git repository. Users can select one or more repositories, hummingbird will keep a scrolling view (ala tweetdeck) of the commits in the project.

Users can filter each project's commits based on files modified, as well as hashtags embedded in the comments.
